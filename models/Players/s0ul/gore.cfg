// gore.cfg is intended to define what sort of gore, blood, or 
// hit-with-something-sharp effects and visuals should be used with a specific
// model in the game, be it a player model, an NPC, or a vehicle of some kind.
// This is the opposite from BaseJKA, where such effects are defined by the 
// weapon that makes them, leading to robots that bleed red blood.
// gore.cfg allows this to be corrected, and expanded upon.
//
// gore.cfg first looks in the model's directory for gore_skinname.cfg
// and if that's not found, looks for gore.cfg in the model's directory.
// If that's not found, and the model is a humanoid model(all playermodels are)
// the default gore.cfg in the players directory is used.
// If no gore.cfg can be found for a vehicle or nonhumanoid model, no gore
// effects at all are used. (Less desirable than using say, sparks or oil effects.)
//
// Valid parameters are(All are required for proper operation of gore.cfg.):
// hitPersonShotEffect (.efx file to play when an impact draws blood.)
// hitPersonShotShader (Shader file to apply to the model where it's been shot.)
// hitPersonBladeEffect (.efx file to play when the model is slashed with a sword.)
// g2MarksBladeShader (Shader file to apply to the model where it's been slashed.))
// g2WeaponMarksBladeShader (Shader file to try to apply to the weapon that's used.)
// dismemberEffect (.efx file to play when a dismemberment occurs. Used twice, on the stump and severed appendage.)
